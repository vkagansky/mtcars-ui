This application is related to the Regression class project. The goal was to explore factors affecting the mailege per gallon. This application illistrates how it could be done using UI (see also thr pdf file in this repository)

My approach was a bit unusual - to start with a reasobably good model and try to improve it.

Evidently, milege depends on the weight (wt) and power of the car (hp, qsec, or both). This application allows to select other variables while making sure that wegth and one of the power characteristics are in the model

So wt is always included; you can choose to select hp, qsec, or both using radio button and can add more variables using checkbox group below
